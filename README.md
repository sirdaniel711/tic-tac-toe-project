# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java. <br />
This is the first game I built on my own, and it is still a work-in-progress.

## Directions
- First, copy the Tic-Tac-Toe folder.
- Next, use a console to navigate to the Tic-Tac-Toe folder.
- Last, type "Java TTTGUI" in a console to run the game.

Note: Requires Java to be installed.
